## Notes

I had a configuration issue in the beginning, and it was fixed after updating my macOS system and XCode. I was not able to automatically update the XCode because there was a virus attack in my system, and was eating up my storage space. However, updating macOS helped to mitigate that issue and allowed me to update XCode.
